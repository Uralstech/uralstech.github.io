Another (brand new) (**the** latest) development update for ezr²!
<!--more-->

### What I've Been Doing

Well, ezr² has got huge performance updates! I'm not planning to add any new features or improvements to the wrapper now, as I just want to release it. Speaking about releasing it...

### THE ezr² INTERPRETER WILL BE RELEASED SOOOOOOON!!!!!!!!!!!

YEAHHHHH!

I am doing some last-minute, last-minute changes⁴ to fix up the interpreter of any glaring bugs and performance issues. I'm also finishing up the reference documentation for the source code!

So, I do want to end this post with a kinda-roadmap.

### ezr² Project Roadmap

| Milestone | Tasks |
|-----------|-------|
| **Releasing the Interpreter** | Releasing the interpreter in its current state. |
| **Adding Missing Features** | Implement support for non-keyword extra parameters for functions and methods. |
| **Proper C# Wrapping Types** | Develop improved C# wrapping types for seamless integration with existing C# libraries. |
| **Include Expression** | Implement the "include" expression. |
| **QuickSyntax Support** | Integrate QuickSyntax support for streamlined scripting. |
