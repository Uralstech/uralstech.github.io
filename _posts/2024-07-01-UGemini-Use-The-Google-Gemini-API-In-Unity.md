My new Unity package!

### Google Gemini

> Gemini, the most capable and general model Google has ever built.
>
> Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research.
> It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video.

Yeah. Now, you can use it in Unity!

Check out UGemini, a C# wrapper for the Google Gemini API.
