It's finally out! What I've been doing for all this time is OUT!

## ezr² v0.1.0

ezr² v0.1.0, the first kinda-working version of ezr² ***RE*** (REwrite) has been
put up on GitHub! You can check it out here:

[![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub_Releases-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&color=FFFFFF&logoColor=000000)](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrSquared/releases)

I've also released reference documentation for the code that makes up ezr² ***RE***!

[![Online RefDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Online_RefDocs-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&color=FFFFFF&logoColor=000000)](https://uralstech.github.io/ezrSquaredRefDocs)

Now, ezr² ***RE*** is still very incomplete. Like, the `include` expression
has not been added, none of the built-in object members like `"a string".length`
or `["a", "list"].insert` have been implemented, none of the libraries have been updated, and so on.

So, don't use it for trying out ezr². If you want to test it out and
help in bug reporting, please feel free to help! You can compile ezr² using
the .NET SDK and/or Visual Studio. The development has been going on solely
on Windows, so it would also be good to know if it's working well in other
environments.

So, that's all for this development update!
