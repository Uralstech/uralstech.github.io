What's new in ezr² ***RE*** v0.1.2 (and v0.1.1)?

## ezr² v0.1.1

Not much. Just updated the website and added art assets for ezr² ***RE***.

## ezr² v0.1.2

The website has been revamped!

The old website was made with Jekyll and the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme.
The new website is completely generated by docfx! Why? I believe docfx is better for ezr² considering it is the .NET
project's own documentation generator. I think it has a better theme out-of-the-box and it also allows me to have the
API reference and main documentation in the same site!

This also means the ezrSquaredRefDocs site is dead. I have archived the repository and there will be no updates.

I've also updated some documentation in the code itself, and have also fixed the build order
for the shell and main project.

> ezr² ***RE*** is still very incomplete. Like, the `include` expression

> or `["a", "list"].insert` have been implemented, none of the libraries have been updated, and so on.
> 
> So, don't use it for trying out ezr². If you want to test it out and
> help in bug reporting, please feel free to help! You can compile ezr² using
> the .NET SDK and/or Visual Studio. The development has been going on solely
> on Windows, so it would also be good to know if it's working well in other
> environments.

So, that's all for this development update!
