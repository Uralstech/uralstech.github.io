An Augmented Reality voice interactive assistive indoor navigation application for the visually impaired is described here using ARCore on Android phones. Humanâ€“machine interaction mechanism is voice activated with turn-by-turn continuous guidance. The app uses ARCore supported Android smartphones to acquire robust computer vision-based localization. Path creation is done using local anchors, which are then uploaded to the cloud. The ARCore Depth API is used for real-time obstacle detection and the app gives voice warning to the user. A prototype named 3rDi 4 All is implemented with the intended functionality and published on google PlayStore.
