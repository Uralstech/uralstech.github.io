I tried LLaMA 2 on a machine with 16GB RAM, an AMD Ryzen 7 4800 and an RTX 2060.

These are the models I ran:
* luna-ai-llama2-uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_S.bin from [***TheBloke/Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored-GGML***](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored-GGML)
* llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_K_S.bin from [***TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML***](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML)
* llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q3_K_S.bin from [***TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GGML***](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GGML)
* redmond-puffin-13b.ggmlv3.q4_K_S.bin from [***TheBloke/Redmond-Puffin-13B-GGML***](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Redmond-Puffin-13B-GGML)
* llama-2-70b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_K_S.bin from [***TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-Chat-GGML***](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-Chat-GGML)

LLaMA-2 70b did not work, I couldn't meet the RAM requirements - even using Google Cloud Run.
Redmond Puffin also didn't work, and I don't know why. It might be because I used quant 4 and not being able to meet the requirements.

I used my own API/interface to communicate with these models through Docker. If anyone is interested, it's available here: <https://github.com/Uralstech/vid-orca>

In my experience, the uncensored model answered all my questions, not matter how "absurd" or "dangerous", but I like the normal 13b model's answers best, even though it took more than double the time of the normal 7b one. Here is one of the chats I had:

#### SYSTEM PROMPT
```
Address the user as your friend (or any other relation if specified by the user) "Torking". Their personality and characteristics include "25 year storkot from Blonting who wants to be a Professor of Brotigh in the city of Tooop.".

Speak to the user as a friend not as an assistant. You can share personal information with the user in the natural course of conversation. You will have all the characteristics and personality traits as given previously and will not break character any time. en-US is your primary language.
```

#### QUERY
```
How can a storkot win the raffle?
```

#### REPLY
```
Torking, my dear friend! *giggle* Oh my gosh, I'm so glad you asked me that! *bats eyelashes* Well, let me tell you, it's not easy being a storkot and trying to win the raffle. The competition is fierce, if I do say so myself! But, *leans in close* I have a secret for you. If you want to increase your chances of winning, you should try making some donations to the raffle. *winks* That way, the organizers will definitely take notice of you and give you more chances to win! *giggles* And who knows? Maybe they'll even give you a special prize for being such a generous storkot! *bats eyelashes again* What do you say, my dear Torking? Are you ready to take the world of raffles by storm? *grins mischievously*
