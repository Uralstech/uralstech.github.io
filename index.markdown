Hi! I'm **Udayshankar Ravikumar**, *PCAP* and *Chief Technology Officer* at [**URAV ADVANCED LEARNING SYSTEMS PRIVATE LIMITED**](https://uralstech.in/). This website is for documentating all my achievements.

## **Android App for Indoor Navigation for The Blind and Visually Impaired**
> An Augmented Reality voice interactive assistive indoor navigation application for the visually impaired is described here using ARcore on Android phones. Human–machine interaction mechanism is voice activated with turn-by-turn continuous guidance. The app uses ARCore supported Android smartphones to acquire robust computer vision-based localization. Path creation is done using local anchors, which are then uploaded to the cloud. The ARCore Depth API is used for real-time obstacle detection and the app gives voice warning to the user. A prototype named 3rDi 4 All is implemented with the intended functionality and published on google PlayStore.

## **Educative Programming Language with Malayalam Syntax**
> ezrM is a basic programming language written in Malayalam meant to be easy to learn.

*GitHub repository*: <https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrMlang>

## **Easy-to-learn and Practical Interpreted Programming Language for Beginners and Experts Alike**
> ezr² is a programming language that's easy to learn and practical to use. ezr² can be learnt by anyone, of any age, in a few minutes. Anyone can extend the functionalities of ezr² with libraries. If you already know C#, you can even help in ezr² development with C# Assisted ezr² Libraries (CSAELs)! CSAELs bring the existing functionality of C# to ezr²! Experienced ezr² programmers can even ditch the boilerplate syntax for the shorter QuickSyntax. The normal syntax satisfies the beginner, as it is easy to use and QuickSyntax satisfies the expert, as it is very short.
